# Big Data in the Cloud

This was a talk I gave at the
[Saint Louis Unix Users Group](http://sluug.org)
on Wednesday, November 8, 2017.

In this talk I'm going to discuss big data in the cloud, how you might go about
processing lots and lots of data without maintaining lots and lots of physical
hardware yourself.  We process petabytes of satellite imagery at Climate for our
customers, and we do this all in AWS with EC2, ECS, DynamoDB, and S3 as the key
technologies, and with much of the rest of their stack as well.
